# Employee-Management-System


Employee Management System (EMS) is a Java-based console application that allows users to perform various operations related to employee management. It provides functionalities like adding employee details, viewing employee details, removing employees, updating employee information, and exiting the application.



The EMS application uses a file-based approach to store employee details. Each employee is represented by a separate text file named after their employee ID. The file contains information such as employee ID, name, father's name, email, position, salary, and contact information.



The application provides a user-friendly menu interface where users can select different options. Here is a brief overview of the menu options:

1.Add an Employee Details: Allows users to enter employee information and creates a new file with the employee details.

2.See an Employee Details: Prompts the user to enter an employee ID and displays the corresponding employee details from the file.

3.Remove an Employee: Asks for an employee ID and removes the corresponding employee file if it exists.

4.Update Employee Details: Takes an employee ID as input and displays the current details. Users can then choose a detail to update (e.g., name, email) and provide the updated information.

5.Exit the EMS Portal: Terminates the application and displays a farewell message.



The code has been structured into separate classes for different functionalities, such as adding, viewing, removing, and updating employee details. This approach ensures modular and organized code.



The EMS application is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to manage employee information in a file-based system. It can be useful for small-scale employee management tasks or as a starting point for more complex systems. The code can be easily shared and used on GitHub or other repositories for collaborative development and further enhancements.
